"0","# = signs are usually used to keep an object's scope to only be in the "
"0","# function/function call."
"0","# e.g. if I do mean(x=1:10), x won't exist, but if I do mean(x<-1:10),"
"0","# x will exist"
"0","extendLimit<-function(v, whichAxis, min=NULL){"
"0","  myMax=max(v)"
"0","  switch(tolower(whichAxis),"
"0","    ""x""=expand_limits(x=c(min,myMax+15)),"
"0","    ""y""=expand_limits(y=c(min,myMax+15))"
"0","  )"
"0","}"
