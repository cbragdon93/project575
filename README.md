# MA575: Linear Modeling Class Project, Fall 2020

This page contains the relevant data and code for the final project in MA575: Linear Modeling, done in the Fall Semester of 2020 in Boston University. The learning goals were to apply what we learned in lectures in lab to gain insight into one of three datasets of our choice. Here, we analyzed the Facebook dataset, described below. All code for the project is located in the analysis directory.
